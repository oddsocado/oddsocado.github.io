Performed at a high level this year and could improve next year (though, maybe with some TD regression) if the Vikings make investments to the o line. There are some minor concerns about Cook&rsquo;s age and mileage, but he should maintain a top 5 ADP.</li><li><strong>Jonathan Taylor, IND</strong>
Would expect a tremendous leap forward next year, more so than what the last 6 games have shown. The last 6 have demonstrated that Taylor can perform at a RB1 level, he has had a good touch count (>15), an acceptable snap percentage (~55%), and great efficiency (18 ppg in standard), and with Marlon Mack likely departing this offseason Taylor will go in the early 2nd at the latest, and most likely in the back half of the first.</li><li><strong>Myles Gaskin, MIA</strong>
Has secured lead back duties in Miami and has proven to be reliable, if maybe a bit flat. He was consistently delivering 7 - 12 points in standard and showed up in a big way for the championship game in week 16. I would anticipate more of the same next season with some possibility of RB1 upside, particularly if the Dolphins offense becomes more potent.</li><li><strong>Cam Akers, LAR</strong>
Really started to turn the corner at the end of the season, though it&rsquo;s still unclear if this guy should be drafted in the first three rounds. Hard to say if he’s going to blow up but as good a speculative add as I’ve seen. Talent and potential opportunity are both present.</li><li><strong>DeAndre Swift, DET</strong>
Clearly very talented, but don’t have too much fantasy relevance without improvements at D (lions were 32nd in points against) and o line (stafford was sacked on 7% of dropbacks). Basically, it&rsquo;s just to easy for Swift to get game scripted out. He did appear to win out the RBBC competition at the end of the year, but is probably not going to be receiving bell cow duties next year.</li><li><strong>AJ Dillon, GB</strong>
Dillon garnered a very high score from ProFootballFocus early on in the 2020 campaign, and demonstrated good efficiency in the one game he had double digit touches. In week 16 of 2020, Dillon rushed for 124 yards on 21 touches and notched 2 TDs, though this was against a weak Titans defense. This all bodes well for the campaign next season in which Dillon is expected to take over the duties of Aaron Jones as Jones becomes a UFA following this season.</li><li><strong>Jeff Wilson Jr, SFO</strong>
Wilson came into the league in 2018 and has since developed a reputation as being a back which has a keen nose for the end zone. In 2020, Wilson managed 106 carries and gained almost 5 yards per carry on average. Wilson will likely not be the lead back next year, that role appears to belong to Raheem Mostert, but still has value goal line back. Given the significant injury history which is accumulating for the other SF backs, it is possible that Wilson will see significant playing time in 2021 and could well produce at RB1 levels in this case.</li><li><strong>Ty Johnson, NYJ</strong>
High risk running back prospect. Has great wheels and put together one nice game this season. Gore is likely out of the picture next season and Gase is gone which means that either Perine or Johnson may deliver good value next season.</li></ul><h2 id=wide-receivers>Wide Receivers</h2><ul><li><strong>DK Metcalf, SEA</strong>
Had a 6% drop rate this year - this guy’s gonna improve next year. Which is kind of scary to think about given his performance this year&mldr;</li><li><strong>DeAndre Hopkins, ARI</strong>
Finished the season as WR9, commanded 150 targets with a 75% catch rate. Think he should be a 3rd round pickup, though he might go higher than that in name alone.</li><li><strong>Justin Jefferson, MIN</strong>
Expected to become the number 1 receiver next year ( could make the argument he is already) will benefit from improvements at o line as Cousins was sacked on 7% of dropbacks</li><li><strong>Robby Anderson, CAR</strong>
Appears to make a difference when you’re not on the Jets. This year he posted a 71% catch rate which is a 16% improvement over the 55%ish be logged in 4 seasons with the Jets. This is possibly due to a reduction in ADOT, but it’s just as likely (if not more likely) that the Panthers just have a more suitable scheme for his abilities. He likely benefits with the return of CMC next season (2 of his 3 100 yard games were with CMC) and we can hope that Bridgewater is improved next season.</li><li><strong>CeeDee Lamb, DAL</strong>
Lamb was a stud this year while Dak was playing, and he had some residual value as a flex after the injury. His catch rate was pretty good (66%), and he&rsquo;s able to deliver about 4 yards after the catch. He should fly pretty low under the radar given that there are other rookies who had better seasons, but with Prescott returning in 2021 looks like he could take a big step forward</li><li><strong>Tee Higgins, CIN</strong>
Rookie season with 900 yards and 6 touchdowns - especially if the Bengals do something to improve their terrible o line.</li><li><strong>Brandon Aiyuk, SFO</strong>
Best receiver in SF, would expect second year improvement which could be buoyed by a change (or even just consistency) at quarterback.</li><li><strong>DJ Chark, JAX</strong>
Took a down year, in what appears to be a combination of fewer targets and a worse catch rate. Minshew&rsquo;s performance was better than during his 2019 campaign, so a lot of the fault for the down year seems to lie with Chark. Lawrence is theoretically the starter next year (though it would likely be better for the Jags to trade back and beef up their O line) and so it might be good to take Chark late.</li><li><strong>Nelson Agholor, LVR</strong>
His catch rate is not good (just 60%) - but his production was better this year than it has ever been (and on fewer targets). I wouldn’t expect much difference next year, but he may be good value just based on ADP.</li><li><strong>Pittman/Pascal, IND</strong>
Either or both of these guys could prove to excel next year - Hilton is expected to depart which should free up 86 targets, and while Pascal appears to have the better nose for the endzone, I think Pittman figures it out in his sophomore year. The biggest limit they will face is Rivers age. Think 8th-10th round or later.</li></ul><h2 id=quarterbacks>Quarterbacks</h2><ul><li><strong>Jalen Hurts, PHI</strong>
My pick for next year’s pleasant surprise quarterback. Appears to fit the model of Mahomes/Jackson/Murray/Allen. Should be able to get much later than any of those.</li><li><strong>Baker Mayfield, CLE</strong>
Perhaps worth a late flyer. Baker put forth a marginal season as QB19, but worth noting is a decline in his interception rate over the previous two seasons and his ANY/A rising above 7.</li></ul><h2 id=tight-ends>Tight Ends</h2><ul><li><strong>TJ Hockenson, DET</strong>
Had an increase in targets, which in an offense that passed the ball less than is previous seasons is noteworthy. Despite the increase in targets this year, this is still only TE3 level of targets (95) with an ok catch rate (65%). Hockenson also had a relatively high drop rate (7%) to boot, so there is room for growth. Both Marvin Jones Jr (104 targets) and Danny Amendola (67 targets) have contracts which expire this year and it’s hard to think they will both be returning meaning that there could be more targets available, but the lions share of these should go to Golladay next year. Nonetheless, it&rsquo;s feasible that Hockenson could see 120 targets catching 70% of them for a total of 84 receptions next year.</li><li><strong>Robert Tonyan, GB</strong>
Will (almost obviously) have TD regression in 2021, as (a) 11 TD is a ton for any receiver not named Travis Kelce, and (b) Rodgers isn’t likely to continue to play at this same level. Tonyan is in a three-way tie for second place in targets on the packers which and has a fantastic catch rates (88%).</li><li><strong>Eric Ebron, PIT</strong>
Frankly, there are simply too many mouths to feed in Pittsburgh. Diontae, Juju, and Claypool will all probably be strong flexes or weak WR2. Ebron is getting TE3 targets, but needs a better catch rate and deeper ADOT to be productive though.</li></ul><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=https%3a%2f%2fwww.oddsocado.com%2fpost%2f2021-up-and-coming-players%2f" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left></div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://www.oddsocado.com/js/ui.js></script><script src=https://www.oddsocado.com/js/menus.js></script><script>window.location.hostname!="localhost"&&(function(a,e,f,g,b,c,d){a.GoogleAnalyticsObject=b,a[b]=a[b]||function(){(a[b].q=a[b].q||[]).push(arguments)},a[b].l=1*new Date,c=e.createElement(f),d=e.getElementsByTagName(f)[0],c.async=1,c.src=g,d.parentNode.insertBefore(c,d)}(window,document,'script','//www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js','ga'),ga('create','G-3LY6QV1HFH','auto'),ga('send','pageview'))</script></body></html>
