# About oddsocado

Oddsocado covers fantasy football from a contrarian perspective, helping managers find opportunities that won't be surfaced in more mainstream blogs/analyses.

## Why?

- Fantasy advice is largely generalized, over publicized (you can throw a stone and hit at least 14 waiver wire recommendations of the same 7 players).

- Most managers already have their favorite blogs they frequent regularly - whether this is rotoballer, fantasypros, or whatever. 

- Managers do not want to see more of the same; they need and want to find information that could give them an edge over their opponents.
