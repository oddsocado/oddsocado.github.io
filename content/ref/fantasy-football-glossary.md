Here's a collection of acronyms and terms common in Fantasy Football that might be unfamiliar to some
managers. This is broken down, not alphabetically, but categorically. You will be able to find all of
the draft related terms grouped together etc.

## The Draft

- **ADP** Average Draft Position - average draft position is the average number of picks before the player is selected. 
It is useful for predicting if a player will be available for a certain turn in the draft, if a player
you are considering is maybe someone you are selecting too early, and if a player is falling down the board
(and therefore maybe good value). Depending on the platform you are using there may be some substantial
variations in where a player might be picked. Some ADP providers will provide information about earliest
and latest picks that player has been selected. One site we recommend is [Fantasy Football Calculator]
(https://fantasyfootballcalculator.com/).

- **Auction Draft** - an auction draft is one in which players are chosen not in order, but by bidding
for them using a league assigned budget. Usually, the auction progresses around the league with each 
manager starting the bidding on a player of their choice. The managers will then bid increasing amounts 
until no manager is willing to bid more than the current bid. At this point the player is assigned to 
the winning manager's team. As such there is no first round, or any round for that matter, and no manager 
is locked out from any player. Auction drafts have a steeper learning curve and require all managers 
to be comfortable with the auction process. It's easy for less experienced managers to bid the wrong
amounts early in the auction and limit the performance potential for their teams.

- **Mock Draft** - a mock draft is a practice draft and is offered by many Fantasy Football providers.
Participating in a mock draft is often a useful exercise for getting a sense of where players will be
selected and gaining an appreciation for your available choices during your actual draft. It can also
help cool any nerves you might have going into the draft by trying it out a couple times and getting
used to the flow.

- **Snake Draft** - a snake draft is the most common type of draft. It involves a sequential selection
of players from the available pool. The manager with the first selection in any given round will have
the last selection in the next round. This type of draft is easier to administer and plan for than an
auction draft.

## League Settings

- **Redraft** - A redraft league is one which removes most or all of the players from each managers rosters
at the end of each season. Then the league re-selects their rosters sometime during the off-season.

- **Dynasty** - A dynasty league is one where all of the players remain on the same roster indefinitely
(or at least until a manager cuts the player). Dynasty managers will perform a draft during the offseason
after the NFL Draft to select rookies. Dynasty leagues typically have Free Agent Acquisition Budget and
allow the trading of draft picks to enable teams to rebuild more effectively.

- **PPR** - Points per Reception - in a PPR league all players will produce one point for every reception
they make. This has the effect of increasing the relative value of Wide Receivers and Tight Ends. Pass
catching Running Backs, such as Alvin Kamara, are often at a premium in such league. Some leagues will 
increase Tight End receptions to two points each in an attempt to improve the relative value at a position
that usually has few consistent performers. 

- **HPPR** - Half Points per Reception - an HPPR league will award half of a fantasy point for each reception
splitting the difference between standard scoring and PPR scoring.

- **Super Flex** - Super Flex is a type of league that allows a Quarterback to be started in the Flex
position each week. These leagues are similar to 2 QB leagues in that it is usually better to start a
random QB in your flex than any other position player. As a result, Super Flex and other 2 QB leagues
have a wildly different draft dynamic than single QB leagues. Generally the draft order in single QB 
leagues favors RB, WR, and TE over QB - but in 2 QB leagues this is turned on its head and QB are taken
through most of the first and second round.

- **Waivers** - Each week players that are not on any fantasy managers rosters will be moved to waivers
at the beginning of their game. These players cannot be added to any team until the waivers clear, typically
a day after the last game of the week (Tuesday). The team that the player goes to will be determined based
on either waiver order or FAAB money. Waiver order is often either inverse standings (lowest performing 
team gets first choice) or rolling (everytime a manager adds a player to their roster they get moved to
the last waiver position).

- **Free Agents** - Players who clear waivers without being added to any team become free agents. These
players can be added immediately to any roster up until they get added back to the waivers whenever 
their next game begins (players on bye weeks generally do not get added to the waivers).

- **FAAB** - Free Agent Acquisition Budget, at the beginning of the season each manager is assigned so
many $ of budget to select players from the waivers. They will bid FAAB money (based on how much is left of
their budget) on the players they would like to add to their teams from Waivers. The team that bids the
most FAAB will win the player (and spend the FAAB money - runners up retain their budget). If there is
a tie (2 or more managers bid the same amount) then the winning manager will be decided by a tiebreaker
sometimes inverse standings. Some leagues additionally allow the trading of FAAB money which can make
for an easier trade environment because FAAB is a bit more incremental.

- **Move Limit** - Some leagues implement a roster move limit. This puts a ceiling on the number of players
that can be added to a teams roster. Having a low ceiling can be particularly constrictive and punish
unlucky managers - however it is a way to level the field between more active managers and less active
managers. If set too high, then there might as well not be any ceiling.
